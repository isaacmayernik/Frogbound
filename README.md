# Frogbound
Frogbound is a 2D Metroidvania where players explore a cave with various enemies such as a beetle, fly, and worm. Along the way, they may come across an upgrade they may help them evade enemy attacks. Players will reach a point where they must defeat a boss, King Diptera, king of the flies. King Diptera will summon enemies and charge around the arena until it becomes dazed. While dazed, players may attack the boss until it runs out of health. Defeating the boss rewards a health upgrade and access to a new area, the ruins. There they may explore, fight more enemies, and receive an upgrade.

### Winning and Losing
For the player to win, they must defeat King Diptera, the fly boss. Upon defeating him, players are rewarded with a health upgrade, and may access the next area, the ruins. This is the end of the game, and players will see an end screen when they reach a certain point.
For the player to lose, they must die during combat by reaching zero hearts. Death is not permanent, as players will respawn at their last save. Thus, players have the chance to learn from their mistakes and try again.
